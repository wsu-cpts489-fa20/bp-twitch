## Team Retrospective #1:

 
Milestone 1 went very well, we even completed some of milestone 2.
One process that could be improved is writing tests and adding them 
in our pull requests. That way tests and features are added together, 
rather than retroactively adding tests. For milestone two the issues 
distribution is as follows:

 
Hunter: autocomplete channel names.

Charlie: Display user information when clicking user name.

Frank: Finish badges and sending chat messages.

Alex: More intuitive scrolling behavior for chat stream.

Rade: Visual authentication indicators, chat styling, environment variables from file.
