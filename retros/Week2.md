## Team Retrospective #2:

### What is going well
> Developmental progress in the application is flowing smoothly.
> We are able to incrementally add features with no blockages.
> Communication between team members is good, when someone gets stuck they always get help.
> The app looks real nice.

### What is not going well
> It's the end of the semester and people are getting busier.
> Lack of motivation to work on the project consistently.
> Review process is shotty at best.
> More testing should be done.

### What can be done to improve the process
> Regular team meetings throughout the week to keep people on track.
> Include tests as part of your developmental PR's.
> More peer to peer communications.
