## Team Retrospective #3:

### What is going well
> Nobody is super dependent on another to get work done.
> Features are still being added, which means we have something to demo.

### What is not going well
> Poor communication from some teammates.
> Lack of motivation to get things done.
> Some features from earlier sprints could not be completed
> for complexity reasons. 

### What can be done to improve the process
> The most impactful way that we could improve our process
> is for everyone to start working on this project diligently.
> More time and effort needs put in.
